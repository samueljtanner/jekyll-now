title: Getting back on the bike
---

I am fat, unfit, and have a large hole in my life where completing my degree used to be, it is time to get back on the bike. 

I have spent the last academic year working full time as well as taking on a full course load for my final year and I have let my fitness go and allowed my body fat % to increase slowly. The year before I completed my first Ultramarathon; Ratrace's 70 mile event 'The Wall' and a number of other off road long distance runs but my uni workload made me lazy in other areas of my life. No more... 

I have now complete my BSc Information Systems and Managment at LSE and am awaiting graduation so it is time to get back the fitness I have lost. 

### Inventory
Two years ago, when moving back to the midlands from the South East, my brother-in-law convinced my to replacy my stolen road bike by finding a Weiler Escape with Campagno group set on Gumtree for Â£300. I had riden the bike on and off through the summer and then left it in the garage over winter where it has stayed till now. for indoor training, the gym at work has a set of Wattbikes that will service my indoor training until I can get myself a decent turbo trainer at home. Luckily my cycling gear all fits, although slightly less well than in the past.

### The plan
I want to do this properly, building the habits slowly so they will stick. To start with I am going to follow British Cycling's [Improvers Plan](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/knowledge/training-plans/beginner/article/izn20160905-Beginner-Introduction-to-the-Improvers%E2%80%99-Plan-0)
