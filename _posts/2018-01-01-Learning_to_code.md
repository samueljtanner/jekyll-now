title: Learning to code
---

I completed a degree in Information Systems and Management at the LSE in May and I now need to make sure that I can execute what I have learned. 

I scored well in my first year programming module and final year Software Engineering project but I want to improve my coding skills in order to be able to produce quick prototypes and understand how long and complicated programing projects I work on will take to make me a better Information Systems (IS) manager.

## 100 days of code
1. https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/ - I spent an hour building this site from some old content. (60 mins)
2. https://www.getpy.com/ - Python course from Printing to Boolean lessons (60 mins)
